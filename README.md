## IPL Scoreboard Analysis

The Indian Premier League is a men's Twenty20 cricket league that is annually held in India. The league, which was founded by the BCCI in 2007, is contested by ten city-based franchise teams. 

We have a dataset having Data of the scoreboard of each matches played in the year 2022.

Being a data analyst we will perform EDA on the data to gain insights like:

-probability of winning a match of a chasing vs defending team.
-top bowlers 
-top players of the match
-top scorer of the IPL-2022
-on which stadium teams won the most matches? 


## Data

- ***IPl-2022  data:*** date, venune, top scorer, tema 1 , team 2, toss winner, match winner, won by, etc.

## Tasks

To clean the available data and prepare the data for EDA. 

To plot graphs representing the trends.

## Checkpoints

The checkpoints for the assignment are as follows:

1. To import the libraries required for the task in jyputer notebook. 

2. To load the dataset and perform EDA using Pandas library.
  
3. Now we will find number of matches won by each  team and plot a bar chart on the derived data.

4. Now we will find value counts of teams won by runs and wickets to look at the probability of winning a match by chasing or defending team. Further we will plot a pie chart to demonstrate it visually.

5. By sorting the value counts of the Player of the match, we could get the data about the players who got the most number of the award as the player of the match, we can visualize it by plotting a bar graph.

6. Similarly, we can have a look at the venue on which the team won most matches by sorting the value count in descending order.
